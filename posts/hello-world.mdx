title: Tiny Chess Engine
---

In this article I'm writing a simple chess engine that provides the basis for the easy prototyping of ideas.

I've made a few chess engines before in a variety of languages:
- Python
- Go
- Rust

None of them were great. Their main issue was that they were poorly planned out and hence had a weak design philosophy driving decisions to add or remove certain features. I just wanted to create an engine that *worked*.

===

===

First, let's create an empty rust package and populate its `Cargo.toml` file.

We'll be using `pleco` to handle the game logic so we can focus on acually creating an engine.

===

```toml
[package]
name = "engine"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
pleco = "0.5.0"
```

===
Some of the features `pleco` implements out of the box:
- Bitboard representation of Piece Locations:
- Ability for concurrent Board State access, for use by parallel searchers
- Full Move-generation Capabilities, including generation of pseudo-legal moves
- Statically computed lookup-tables (including Magic Bitboards)
- Zobrist hashing
- A transposition table --> Lightning fast lookup table storing information for a board
- Pre-implemented searchers, some of which using [rayon.rs](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) for easy parallelism

===

```rust
use pleco::{Board, PieceType, Player};

fn main() {
    let board = Board::start_pos();

    // count pawns belonging to white
    let piece_no = board.count_piece(
        Player::White, 
        PieceType::P
    );
    assert_eq!(piece_no, 8);

    println!("{}", board.fen());
}
```

===

I'm going to split my engine into two broad sections:
- Search --> This handles how the search space is traversed
- Evaluation --> This handles how positions are statically evaluated

===

===

# Search

We're going to focus on a simple minimax search for now. Ideally, we'd build a system which allows us to write drop-in replacements for the search algorithm without affecting the other parts of the engine.

===

===

# Evaluation

Let's write a simple evaluation function which takes a position and returns a score representing the advantage for the player whose turn it currently is.

Pleco provides us with a helpful `ScoredMove` we can use to keep track of nodes we decide to stop searching on and their respective scores.

===

```Rust
fn evaluate(){

}
```
